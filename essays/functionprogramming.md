Over the course of 5 months, I've learned alot about software engineering. I learned how apply functional coding to a real world environment working with a small team on a practical project. When reflecting back on this time, I enjoyed using github's issue-driven project management. When working with my team on the virtual campus tour, we utlized agile projet management to meet our deadlines and to collaborate more effectively. 

Learning how to use github showed me the importance of collaboration and identifying configuration management so we can separate and control our work. Being able to work on the code without impacting my teammate's code and being able to version control in the event of a code-breaking error, is essential to maintaining stable and viable code. It was game-changing for me when I can work on code at the same time as one of my teammates without having to worry about impacting code that they're working on.

These skills can be applied to any professional software engineering field and will only further develop going forward.  

I believe that learning these skills have helped me futher my skills as a software developer and I look forward to learning more.
