  <p>Effective Modular coding is the key to efficient and timely programming. Modular coding is the creation and utilization of code that can be reimplemented and adjusted based on each use case. Modular coding is most effective when used to streamline common design patterns. When coding we can use the concept of common design patterns to breakdown the coding process into much simpler steps. Rather than coding every single line individually this allows us to reuse code that we’ve already created.</p>

<p>Being able to identify design patterns are an essential skill to all programmers. It allows us to make effective decisions to reduce working time and run time. A design pattern is a reoccurring theme within the program. For example, certain components on a website like a card or carousel could be reused on other pages on the website. Designing the component allows us to use that code in multiple places. Another example is a function, when running an action that you know is repeatable, you can simply call the function whenever and wherever it’s needed.</p>

<p>By making code modular it allows coders to identify issues in the code much clearer. By having a clear understanding of the design patterns, error messages become even more effective as we can identify where code is failing and how. Without a clear understanding of design patterns, debugging can easily become a painstaking process as following code without that understanding makes it much more difficult to follow the code.</p>

<p>I’ve used design patterns frequently, both professionally and personally. It’s an effective skill to use on a daily basis. Engineers can write a robust program to work for any situation and adapt it for specific uses. While I was interning at a HVAC company, I had the opportunity to write climate control programs for large hotels in Waikiki. By writing a program that I could use for any room at a hotel allowed me to reuse my code effectively and modify for specific uses.</p>

<p>In my ICS 314 class, I’m able to utilize design patterns to reduce my time coding websites. By creating reusable components that I can implement on any webpage allows me to reduce my time working on coding and more on the overall flow of the website. This leads to smoother websites and less issues when debugging. I believe that being able to identify design patterns is beneficial to everyone, not just engineers and programmers. Patterns are some of the most fundamental parts of life, being able to identify them and react accordingly is an incredible advantage over those who cant.</p>
