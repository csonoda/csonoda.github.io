Learning Javascript is a good entryway into the world of coding. Having learned Javascript it is undeniably one of the easier languages to learn and is widely applicable. In my ICS 314 course, one of the first tasks we were given was to learn Javascript, and very quickly. Having learned Java and C beforehand helped greatly as solving 150 problems with increasing difficulty on the first week of class isn’t the most pleasurable process without a good background. Javascript is certainly a more forgiving language and more easily usable. Javascript is one of the core languages that we use on the internet today.

Learning JavaScript was fairly straightforward. I was able to utilize my previous coding experience in Java. Learning Java was difficult for me. Homework and tests on Java were fairly difficult for me but having experienced it, it made me a much better coder. This allowed me to fully understand the differences between Java and JavaScript. In JavaScript you don’t need to define variable type unlike Java. Most interestingly, functions are treated like first class citizens,    meaning that functions are treated like objects in object oriented programming. 

After learning JavaScript, I feel like it is overall a good programming language for software engineering. It’s a fundamental programming language that’s widely used and for good reason. It’s very versatile and powerful while remaining very simple. Some disadvantages is that all the interpretation for Javascript is dependant on the browser and that javascript is client-side which could be manipulated.

In my ICS 314 class, we utilize athletic software engineering to better our learning experience. Through WOD problems, which are times coding problems, we’re exercising our ability to code. Through WODs it allows us to check our understanding of Javascript and other languages. I personally enjoy the WOD problems, I believe it goes well with the curriculum and improves critical thinking and shows mastery. However, I don’t believe that that is the best and only way to improve and grade by skill. I believe that it also causes unnecessary stress and disparity amongst those who are good in test-taking. This is the same issue found in standardized testing like the SATs. I believe WODs are excellent practicing tools but don’t truly reflect the full picture and shouldn’t be considered as a standard.  I will continue on my journey to learn more about programming, hopefully this leads to being able to make it a career in the future. I enjoyed learning Javascript and once I learn more about web development I’ll be able to fully realize the potential of the language.
