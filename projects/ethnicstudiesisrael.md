Israel is in constant conflict with its surrounding countries. Despite this, a study done by the United Nations known as the World Happiness Report showed that Israel is very happy. 

Its people donâ€™t reflect the geopolitical and international issues surrounding the country. Research shows that the World Happiness Index is based off 6 values and ranks 156 countries. Israel ranks 13th compared to the United States at 20th. 

Researching Propaganda in Israel led me to find that Propaganda is widely used to support nationalist views both internally and externally. Many groups have a department specifically to support nationalist views.

However, no conclusive evidence was found supporting that propaganda was used to influence the results of the survey. However, results were found that based the Happiness value mostly on GDP. Israel also scored low in the area of Corruption.
