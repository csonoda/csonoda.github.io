# What is the Virtual Campus Tour?

There are thousands of students who apply for the University each year. But as a college far away from the continental United States, it makes it harder to explore the campus or make an in person visit. Many students visit campuses each year to determine whether the college is the best fit for them. Those who are unable to visit the campus in person can only go off of information they find online.

This Semester, Fall 2022, My group and I set out to improve upon the current campus tour. We developed several pages that encompassed the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus from the student life to the research projects in the Computer Scienced Department. This way, it gives prospective students a chance to see if the University is a good fit for them, in a simple to follow tour.

My personal contribution to the Project were mainly front-end development. Creating and working on issues and compiling them on project boards and pages. Designing the Dorming page, Dining and more. I also contributed the main logo for the project itself.

# What was the result?

I learned alot whilst tackling this project. It definitely is a learning process when using issue-based projects to collaborate with team-members. It shows you the importance of the modularity of code and how when one core function of the project is bad, it can cause a chain reaction affecting th entire project. Good communication is key to overcoming obstacles and being able to collaborate effectively. Being able to meet deadlines and notifiying others to changes and information when needed.
